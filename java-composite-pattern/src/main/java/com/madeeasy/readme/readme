**Java Composite Pattern: Treating Individual and Composite Objects Uniformly**

The Composite Design Pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects (composites) uniformly.
It represents a tree structure of objects where both individual objects and composite objects are treated as "components."

**Example:**

Here's an example of a composite pattern in Java that represents a tree structure of departments and employees:

   Company
    /     \
Development  Marketing
 /     \         |
Alice   Bob    Charlie

In this representation:

Company is a composite object that contains two department groups: Development and Marketing.
Development and Marketing are also composite objects that contain individual employees: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
The composite pattern allows you to treat individual employees and groups of departments uniformly, as both
implement the same Department interface and can be part of the hierarchical structure.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component Interface
interface Department {
    void printDepartmentInfo();
}

// Leaf (Individual Object)
class Employee implements Department {
    private String name;

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void printDepartmentInfo() {
        System.out.println("Employee: " + name);
    }
}

// Composite (Group of Departments)
class DepartmentGroup implements Department {
    private String groupName;
    private List<Department> departments = new ArrayList<>();

    public DepartmentGroup(String groupName) {
        this.groupName = groupName;
    }

    public void addDepartment(Department department) {
        departments.add(department);
    }

    @Override
    public void printDepartmentInfo() {
        System.out.println("Department Group: " + groupName);
        for (Department department : departments) {
            department.printDepartmentInfo();
        }
    }
}

// Client Code
public class CompositePatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee employee1 = new Employee("Alice");
        Employee employee2 = new Employee("Bob");
        Employee employee3 = new Employee("Charlie");

        DepartmentGroup developmentGroup = new DepartmentGroup("Development");
        developmentGroup.addDepartment(employee1);
        developmentGroup.addDepartment(employee2);

        DepartmentGroup marketingGroup = new DepartmentGroup("Marketing");
        marketingGroup.addDepartment(employee3);

        DepartmentGroup company = new DepartmentGroup("Company");
        company.addDepartment(developmentGroup);
        company.addDepartment(marketingGroup);

        company.printDepartmentInfo();
    }
}
```

**How to Identify When to Apply the Composite Design Pattern:**

1. **Tree Structure:** When you have a hierarchical structure of objects where individual objects and compositions
 of objects need to be treated uniformly.

2. **Common Interface:** If you want to apply the same operations or methods to both individual objects and composites.

3. **Component Relationship:** When you need to represent part-whole relationships between objects.

**Where to Apply the Composite Design Pattern:**

- **User Interfaces:** In graphical user interfaces where UI elements can be nested within others (e.g., widgets within panels).

- **File System:** Representing files and directories in a file system as a tree structure.

- **Organization Hierarchy:** Representing organizational hierarchies with employees, teams, departments, etc.

- **Graphics Libraries:** Representing shapes, figures, or scenes where complex compositions can be built.

- **Menu Systems:** Building hierarchical menu systems where menus and submenus can be nested.

By applying the Composite Design Pattern, you can create flexible and extensible structures that allow you to build
complex compositions from individual components, while treating them uniformly in terms of their interactions and behaviors.
